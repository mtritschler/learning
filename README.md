Collection of resources for learning about various topics.

* [x] ~Something that I already looked at but didn't find that useful but also don't want to delete~

  > Interesting on two fronts: proving system correctness may lead to useful 
  > tools and software development systems, and work on this to date has largely 
  > been around single-threaded programs. Anyone who has debugged multi-threaded 
  > code knows how much more difficult it is to reason about such systems

  > We must strive to make our programs as easy to understand to other programers 
  > as possible. Ease of comprehension should be the tally with which we measure 
  > our programs. We should keep in mind that we can arrange our code in many 
  > different ways to solve a computing problem, but not all those arrangements 
  > will favor human communication and understanding. We must ask ourselves: is 
  > someone reading my code going to understand how I solved this particular 
  > problem?

Focuses on language concepts and some central ideas of FP in terms of Scala (e.g. immutability, higher-order functions, Monads). Quite alright if you have experience with Java and want to learn or refresh your Scala knowledge)

## Other
* [x] [Just own the damn robots. -- Joshua M Brown](http://thereformedbroker.com/2017/10/16/just-own-the-damn-robots/)
  > we could be in the midst of the first fear-based investment bubble in American history, with the masses buying in not out of avarice, but from a mentality of abject terror. Robots, software and automation, owned by Capital, are notching new victories over Labor at an ever accelerating rate. It’s gone parabolic in recent years – every industry, every region of the country, and all over the world. It’s thrilling to be a part of if you’re an owner of the robots, the software and the automation. If you’re a part of the capital side of that equation.

  > If you’re on the other side, however – the losing side – it’s a horror movie in slow motion.
